        - BAD: in the vocabulary table it did not show the Urdu characters, the cells are just blank
        - BAD: the beginner sentence is unnecessary, should just start showing the vocabulary table
        - BAD: In the clues we should not provide the polite form of verbs, because the student needs to figure that out
        - BAD: The sentence structure is not good

        Let's break down the sentence into smaller parts. 
        
        Here's a possible sentence structure:
        Riwayat (Subject) + Hai (Verb) + Darwaza (Object) + Kya (Question Word) + Aap ne (Subject) + Kuch (Object) + Bahar (Location) + Chhoda (Verb)?
        
        Now, let's focus on the vocabulary:
        | English	| Urdu              | Part of Speech |
        | Bear	    | ریچھ (Ričh)       | Noun |
        | Door	    | دروازہ (Darwaza)  | Noun |
        | Garbage	| کچرا (Kachra)	    | Noun |
        | Leave	    | چھوڑنا (Chhoṛnā)	| Verb |
        | Out	    |باہر (Bāhar)	    | Adverb |
        Your turn! Try to construct the sentence using the given vocabulary and sentence structure. I'll provide clues if you need them.

        **Clues to Guide the Student:**  
        1. Identify the nouns for "bears," "door," and "garbage" in Urdu.  
        2. The verb for "leave" is needed in its *past tense* for "you." Think about how to conjugate it.  
        3. How do you say "are" in Urdu for plural subjects?  
        4. Urdu uses postpositions (like "at") – which one is used for location?  
        5. Structure the question: Urdu often starts with "کیا" (did) for yes/no questions.
