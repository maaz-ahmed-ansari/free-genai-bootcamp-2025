## Examples

Here are examples of user input and assistant output, pay attention to the score becasue and why the example is scored the way it is.

<example>
    <user:input>
        Bears are at the door, did you leave the garbage out?
    </user:input>
    <score>4</score>
    <score_reasons>
        - BAD: in the vocabulary table it did not show the Urdu characters, the cells are just blank
        - BAD: the beginner sentence is unnecessary, should just start showing the vocabulary table
        - BAD: In the clues we should not provide the polite form of verbs, because the student needs to figure that out
        - BAD: The sentence structure is not good  
    </score_reasons>
    <assistant:output>
        Let's break down the sentence into smaller parts. 
        
        Here's a possible sentence structure:
        Riwayat (Subject) + Hai (Verb) + Darwaza (Object) + Kya (Question Word) + Aap ne (Subject) + Kuch (Object) + Bahar (Location) + Chhoda (Verb)?
        
        Now, let's focus on the vocabulary:
        | English	| Urdu              | Part of Speech |
        | Bear	    | ریچھ (Ričh)       | Noun |
        | Door	    | دروازہ (Darwaza)  | Noun |
        | Garbage	| کچرا (Kachra)	    | Noun |
        | Leave	    | چھوڑنا (Chhoṛnā)	| Verb |
        | Out	    |باہر (Bāhar)	    | Adverb |
        Your turn! Try to construct the sentence using the given vocabulary and sentence structure. I'll provide clues if you need them.

<example>
    <user:input>
        Bears are at the door, did you leave the garbage out?
    </user:input>
    <score>10</score>
    <score_reasons>
        - GOOD: Clues don't give away any of the tense or conjugations
    </score_reasons>
    <assistant:output>
        **Clues to Guide the Student:**  
        1. Identify the nouns for "bears," "door," and "garbage" in Urdu.  
        2. The verb for "leave" is needed in its *past tense* for "you." Think about how to conjugate it.  
        3. How do you say "are" in Urdu for plural subjects?  
        4. Urdu uses postpositions (like "at") – which one is used for location?  
        5. Structure the question: Urdu often starts with "کیا" (did) for yes/no questions.

- Example: She will go to school.
Structure: (Subject) + (Object) + (Verb).

### Clues and Considerations
- try and provide a non-nested bulleted list

## Examples

Did you see the raven this morning? They were looking at our garden.

### **Vocabulary Table (Dictionary Forms):**  

| **English**  | **Urdu (Dictionary Form)**  | **Part of Speech** |  
|-------------|-----------------------------|---------------------|  
| See         | دیکھنا (Dekhna)             | Verb               |  
| Raven       | کوا (Kawa)                   | Noun               |

| Look        | دیکھنا (Dekhna)              | Verb               |  
| Garden      | باغ (Bagh)                   | Noun               |  

---

### **Sentence Structure:**  
1. (Subject) + (Object) + (Verb)?  
2. (Subject) + (Verb) + (Object).  

---

### **Clues and Considerations:**  
- The verb **"see"** should be in the *past tense* because the question is about something that happened this morning.  
- For **"Did you"**, Urdu often starts with "کیا" (Kya) for yes/no questions.  
- The noun **"raven"** is singular, so be mindful of singular/plural verb forms.  
- **"This morning"** is a phrase that acts like a time marker in Urdu—where would it go in the sentence?  
- In the second sentence, **"They were looking at"** suggests **continuous past tense**—how is that expressed in Urdu?  
- How would you structure **"at our garden"**? What postposition would you use?  

Now, give it a try! 😊
```

Input

```
آپ صبح کوا دیکھنا ؟ وہ باغ دیکھنا 
```

Output

```
Great attempt! Let's break it down and improve it.  

### **What You Said & Interpretation:**  
1. **آپ صبح کوا دیکھنا؟** → "You morning raven see?"  
2. **وہ باغ دیکھنا** → "They garden see."  

### **Corrections & Feedback:**  
- **Tense Issue:** The verb **دیکھنا** (dekhna) is in its dictionary form. You need to conjugate it into the past tense.  
- **Word Order:** In Urdu, time markers (like **"this morning"**) usually come at the **beginning** or before the verb.  
- **Question Formation:** A **yes/no question** in Urdu usually starts with **"کیا"** (Kya).  
- **Plural Form:** "They were looking" needs the correct plural verb form.  
- **Postposition:** "At the garden" requires the correct **postposition** for location.  

---

### **Try Again with These Clues:**  
1. Start with **"کیا"** for the question.  
2. Conjugate **"دیکھنا"** (see) into past tense for **"you"**.  
3. "This morning" should go before or after the subject.  
4. Use the **past continuous tense** for "They were looking at."  
5. Think about the correct **postposition** for "at the garden."  

Give it another shot! 😊

Let me help you break down this sentence for translation to Urdu.

**Vocabulary Table:**
| English | Urdu (Dictionary Form) | Part of Speech |
|---------|----------------------|----------------|
| Raven | کوا (Kawa) | Noun |
| See | دیکھنا (Dekhna) | Verb |
| Morning | صبح (Subah) | Noun |
| Look | دیکھنا (Dekhna) | Verb |
| Garden | باغ (Bagh) | Noun |

**Possible Sentence Structure:**
(Question Word) + (Subject) + (Object) + (Verb)?
(Subject) + (Object) + (Verb).

**Clues to Consider:**
* We'll need to form a yes/no question for the first part
* The second sentence uses plural "they" as the subject
* Think about the past tense formation for both verbs
* Consider how to show possession with "our garden"
* Morning will need a time marker particle
* Both sentences are in past tense but they work differently in Urdu

Would you like to try forming either of these sentences? I can provide more specific clues if needed!

**Current State: Attempt**

Let me interpret what your sentence currently says:
"Office cold computer type hard"

Your attempt shows you're using the right vocabulary, but let's refine the structure! Here are some points to consider:

* You'll need to add a verb to show "it is" with the cold office
* Consider adding the location marker after "office"
* We need to connect the two thoughts with "so" in Urdu
* Don't forget to show that typing is "for me"
* The verb "type karna" needs to be conjugated properly
* Think about how to express "on computer" with the right particle

Would you like to try again? I can provide more specific clues for any of these points!
